## Read: 02 The Coder's Computer Reading

- [The Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)

- [Basic Navigation](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/navigation.php)

- [About Files](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/aboutfiles.php)

These sections provide insight in how to navigate the terminal to move around your directory, folders, and files.  Given setting up the coder computer was completely based on terminal commands I would be completely lost without the available information.  I can only imagine how much we are going to be using the terminal in the next few days, so I will be referring to this page daily.  
This also reminds me of a game called World of Haiku that makes you use commands in a terminal to navigate through files to find specific things the game is asking you to look for. Could be good practice in the future.

## Cheat Sheet from above links

- pwd  , print working directory (you are here command)
- ls, list (the contents of the directory where I am),
- ls filename, can list whats inside a folder instead of going into the folder itself
- you can also type ls -l to geenerate the information in a list format
- ls -a, shows HIDDEN files
- clear will clear the generated items so far on the screen
- cd filename/filename (change directory)
- cd .. move back up 1 directory level
- cd .. every dot after the initial 2 will move me back up an additional directory
- mkdir foldername  , make directory, another folder essentially, spaces in names will generate multiple folders, spaces in names break things
- touch filename.md, to create a new file in a location, files need extensions .html, .md, .jpg, etc
- code . , will launch my code editor (VStudio)
- can use arrow keys up and down to traverse the history of commands and edit them using left and right arrows if you need a repeat command
- ~ is a shortcut to home directory, cd with no arguments can also do this
- relative path is a file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system
- absolute path is a file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system
-file [path] can be used to find out what type a file is, ex. .png or .txt. or .gif etc.
-if a file has a space in the name use the ' ' or " " marks to get around the error you will receive with using a space

### Things I want to know more about

- I will have many questions when we start to manipulate the terminal more, for now I think I get the simple commands posted above.
