### Read 01: Learning Markdown

- [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

1. Very handy quick guide for markdown styling.
2. Learned there are alternate text to creat headings using Heading level with ---- or =====
3. Nested block quotes can be done using >> under a > to create connected nested quotes
4. Numerical values with listed items will translate to correct order regardless of what is inputted. Could be used for demo reasons, not something I would do in code.
5. Starting unordered lists with a number requires a \. to work properly so - 1968\. as an example
6. Lot of the link and reference material will need to be looked at frequently when utilizing to maintain correct syntax.
7. DON'T TRY TO MEMORIZE, use the find command on webpage. 


- [Mastering Markdown on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

1. Extremely useful MDN style webpage.
2. Can easily navigate to sections using the side bar links.
3. Footnotes are extremely easy to add based off the provided syntax[^1].


- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

1. Jekyll is an open source tool that transform plain text files to websites, but can support variable, templates and drafts as well.
2. Pre built themes are available to be applied directly to your projects.
3. Lot of the material covered, was what we covered in class today.

## Things I want to know more about
- How to stylize or set themes.
- Figure out how to make the emoji cheat sheet work for me, I had to use emojipedia and paste directly.
- Go more into detail with referencing issues and pull requests section on the Mastering Markdown on GitHub site.
