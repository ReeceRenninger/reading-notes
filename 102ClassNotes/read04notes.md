# Read 04: Structure web pages with HTML

1. [Wireframe and Design](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe/)

- Plain black and white diagrams before building anything in code to allow better understanding of how users may interact
- Hand drawing may be better at first then translating it over later
- Possibly use excalidraw as well
- UXPin , InVision, and Wireframe.cc are free online tools as well.
- Use research and best practices when putting together your wireframe over even try to add your own flair
- Map out user flows visually so you can code better later, this button takes them here, etc etc.
- Once you have feedback and made changes, you can feed your wireframe into a program (Invision for example) and create a prototype.
- Clarity, Confidence and Simplicity are key.

2. [Mozilla HTML Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)

- Familiar with most of this already from self teaching.
- Good place for quick reference if needed, but [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) can provide the same info and much more.

3. [Semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)

- Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code.
- NO USING DIV, yet
- [HTML elements link for reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

Skim Material

[Mozilla HTML Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

[Mozilla HTML Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

- Book marked all links above
- MDN seems to be the dominant location for reference and finding how to use tags,elements, etc with proper syntax as well.

## Things I want to know more

- Right now I feel pretty good with all the above information, I will have to work on my drawing skills or use a program for wireframing.
