## Growth Mindset

[Upgrade your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice)

- Reading this really hones in on the aspect of deliberate practice over just practicing.  
- Putting in the reps to get a concept down and set good goals to aim for will provide better skills than trying to just get a small amount of knowledge on a vast information base.
- The [Crypto Challenges](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://cryptopals.com/) seem like an interesting concept on how to hone in on reps to get a concept down as well as the [Rosalind](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://rosalind.info/about/) challenges. The crypto challenges seem to be something I have no idea how to approach at this time though.

[Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en)

- The not yet idea of how to approach grading scale seems really interesting.
- Engaging with your error can be one of our most powerful learning tools for ourselves.
- Process praise and rewarding yet seem like really good ways to develop more effort and engagement with problems.
- I may not understand everything YET, but I will get there if I push out of my comfort zone.

[Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance)

- Grit was something I learned about during my time in the military. Going for days or weeks on low supplies, no sleep, constant pressure taught me that maintaning perserverance and passion for what I was doing.
- Living life like it is a marathon is a good mentality to keep.
- The ability to learn can change based off your effort.
- Failure is not a permanent state.

[Your emotional intelligence](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/201/emotional-intelligence-assessment.html)

- Last time I did this assessment I had a lot of room to improve on social awareness and relationship management.  However, this time I scored much higher in those categories but still below the 18 threshold for improvement as stated.  Self-awareness and self-management I scored much higher both being above 20.  Every time I do this emotional intelligence assessment, I see places I can improve on.  This is something I think I will try and re-assess every 6 months or so.

[Your biases](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/301/bias-assessment.html)

- Last time I took this survey I scored in the 60s and this time I scored 73.  I still have an insane amount of improvement to make in regards to my bias.  I do not feel like I am very bias towards people due to my military experience. I got to work with people from all over the country and was exposed to a lot of different cultures and ideas.  I know I have to continue working on this, because I am still well under the score I want to be for this assessment.
