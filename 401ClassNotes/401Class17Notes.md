## Notes: AWS: S3 and Lambda

[AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

- Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable and highly durable cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.
- Amazon S3 has various use cases, including storing and distributing static website content, backup and recovery of data, hosting media files for streaming, archiving and long-term data storage, and serving as a data lake for big data analytics and machine learning applications.
- Amazon S3 has unlimited scalability allowing you to store and retrieve ANY AMOUNT OF DATA. It also has a cost-effective storage solution with its pay as you go model where you only pay for the storage you utilize.

[AWS Lambda Basics](https://www.serverless.com/aws-lambda)

- AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers, paying only for the compute time consumed by your code.
- AWS Lambda is in the development of serverless microservices, where individual functions can be deployed as Lambdas to handle specific tasks or business logic, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution.
- "Serverless" refers to a cloud computing model where developers can run their applications and functions without the need to manage or worry about the underlying infrastructure, allowing them to focus solely on writing code and delivering functionality.

[CDN](https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/content-delivery-network-cdn/)

- A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a distributed network of servers located around the world that efficiently delivers web content to users by caching and serving it from the server closest to their geographic location, reducing latency and improving performance.
- When a website visitor requests content from a website the CDN works by serving the content from the server closest to the visitors geographical location to reduce distance data has to travel.
- CDN gives global scalability, enhanced reliability, DDos mitigation, and improved website performance.

## Reflection

- Understanding how to use the Lambda console and properly set up the simulated environments seems like the biggest goal for this module.
