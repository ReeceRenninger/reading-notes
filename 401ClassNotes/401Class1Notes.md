## Notes:

[Review if helpful: An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js)

- Node is a behind the scenes engine that was created to operate behind the chrome browser window that you open.  It allows for JavaScript to be executed on a website that adds in that interactive nature you use with clicking, opening, or even some information that is shown via another website or database that is holding the information.

- Node is a JavaScript runtime which means we can execute JavaScript using Node in the simplest explanation.  

- Node allows for users to run JavaScript DIRECTLY ON THEIR COMPUTER rather than it being ran in a browser.  This allows for server-side applications with the ability to access their system and local files to build a fully functional application.

## Additional Questions

- I think I look most forward on how we are going to be building out our own express server and how we are going to have 2 group projects.  The group projects have always been really nice in developing group working skills and how to come at problems with a lot of avenues of solutions from multiple people.  The group projects have been the most fun I have had in the classes so far.

- Everything feels like it is going to be an important learning goal looking at all the new things we are going to be learning.  I definitely feel as though all of this material is going to be new to me and have a lot of use in creating applications and how I can further develop my skills.
