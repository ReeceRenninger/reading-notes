## Ethics in Workplace

[Microsoft and the DOD](https://web.archive.org/web/20200616232735/https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-employees-protest-contract-us-army-hololens-2019-2)

- At the very beginning of the article from 2019 it mentions that Microsoft's contract with the US Army was worth 749 million. The amount of money that "went missing" even during my time was staggering. I can't imagine what it is now. I'm sure it's in the billions after seeing how much a contract to the US Army was in this situation. The Visual Augmentation System(IVAS) is definitely a complicated issue.  As I see and understand how employees would be upset at how it could be used, it also could have saved the lives of soldiers in the heat of the moment.  All our training is just that training, when the actual event occurs, a lot of people freeze up regardless of that training.  Being able to simulate the use of their weapons in a augmented reality combat situation could help break nerves and prevent soldiers from dying.  However, it does have the capacity to make them more lethal to an enemy which is still a loss of life regardless.  I don't know how I would react if my company did something like this in the future.  I am a veteran so I can be biased, but I also know that the global scope of our militaries is not what everyone hopes it to actually be.

## Ethics in Technology

[Self Driving Car Ethics](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2017/11/21/self-driving-cars-ethics/804805001/)

- As we progress as a society our expectations of drivers has declined every year since I got my license.  I talked to people who just got their license and they have to do a fraction of the testing that I had to do less than 15 years ago.  Schools also no longer offer driver's education in most areas now.  These two things coupled has resulted in an absurd amount of terrible drivers in California.  I am for self driving cars because once they become standard for road ways, computers interacting with computers is a lot better than a computer trying to anticipate a human.  The article used a bus of children as an example of what an AI car would do.  But failed to talk about how in that snap moment, people aren't going to be thinking, oh no, I can't let this bus go off the road, what about the children.  Human reaction will be to preserve its own life biologically.  That is something we are hardwired for in those quick moments.  A computer would probably be able to make a safer calculated decision for all parties involved impartially once it has been fed enough information throughout machine learning to anticipate what to do in that situation.  I think the biggest issue is that we are not ready for self driving cars because we are not ready to give up control of our own lives to a computer.  We are not ready to accept that we are not the best drivers on the road. The revolution of self driving cars will not come without mistakes and accidents happening, but I think it will be a lot safer than what we have now.
