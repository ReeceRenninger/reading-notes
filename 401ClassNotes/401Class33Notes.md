[What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-role-based-access-control-rbac-examples-benefits-and-more)

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security model that manages and controls resource access based on user roles and associated permissions. It simplifies administration by separating privileges into roles and ensures users only have access to the resources required for their roles, enhancing security and scalability in systems with multiple users.
- Admin roles could be set to have access to all CRUD functionalities, while a user role could be set to only have access to read and update functionalities, and a guest user role could be set to only have access to read functionality.
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) offers several benefits in managing access to resources within a system, here is a couple of them:

    Improved Security: RBAC enhances security by ensuring that users have only the necessary permissions required for their assigned roles. It minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches by limiting user privileges to specific resources based on their roles.

    Simplified Administration: RBAC simplifies the administration of access control by centralizing permissions and user management at the role level. It reduces the complexity of managing individual user permissions and allows administrators to assign and modify access rights based on predefined roles, streamlining the administrative tasks associated with user access management.

- React Cookie include some features:

    Cookie Management: React Cookie allows you to easily set, get, and remove cookies within your React components. You can set a cookie with a specific name, value, and options such as expiration time, domain, and path. You can retrieve the value of a cookie by its name, and you can remove a cookie by specifying its name and options.

    Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Support: React Cookie is compatible with server-side rendering frameworks like Next.js. It provides a universal cookie instance that allows you to manage cookies both on the server and the client. This ensures consistent cookie handling between server-side rendering and client-side rendering.
- React cookies is a component that provides a simple interface for working with browser cookies in React applications. It is a wrapper around the react-cookie library that provides a declarative API for working with cookies in React components. It allows you to set, get, and remove cookies within your React components using a simple syntax. It also provides SSR support and TypeScript compatibility.
- I think how React cookie handles API handling is a better fit for me due to it being lightweight and minimalistic. It doesn't seem to have a lot of complex features that I would have to learn, and it seems to be very easy to use.
