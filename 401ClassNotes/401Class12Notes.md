## Notes:

[Web Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

- A Web Socket is a computer communications protocol which provide communication channels over a TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) connection.
- To allow for compatibility the WebSocket will handshake using HTTP headers to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket Protocol. Once this happens the protocol allows for interaction to occur between the browser and the server.
- Web sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a REQUEST from that client.

[Socket.io tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket.io/)

- the io.on event handler is a listener to a specified event name which triggers a provided callback function the the matching event is received.
- After doing your initial setup on your server you can run nodemon app.js if you have implemented your http.listen with some type of prompt to be printed once it launches.
- socket.emit() sends a message to all connected clients. This code will notify when a user connects to the server.

[Socket.io vs Web Sockets](https://www.educba.com/websocket-vs-socket-io/)

- Socket.io is a library that enables real-time and full-duplex communication between clients and web servers.  To do this it uses WebSocket protocol to provide the interface.  WebSocket remains opens all the time so they allow for real time data transfer.
