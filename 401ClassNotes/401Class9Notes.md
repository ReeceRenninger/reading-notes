## Notes: Authorization/Authentication

[Read today's Lab Requirements](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-09/lab/)

1. Game review/purchase site.  We could implement some type of tables in SQL to hold information on the games and allow for reviews to be added in with the schema.  If we could develop it further we could maybe add in some type of link connection to steam to allow users to connect their login from our page to steam to allow them to add to cart and direct them to the steam store page. Use a steam API or game library if they are available.

2. Weather style app.  Implement a weather API that uses lat and long targeting that could allow users to login and lock in their location to see the weather for the upcoming week.  We could also implement some type of way to check if the user was going to receive bad weather and give them a warning on log in for the specific days.

## Reflection

- README was pretty short for this reflection.  I would like to feel comfortable with building an API Auth server with full CRED operations.
