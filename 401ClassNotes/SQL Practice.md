## Notes on Practice from [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/)

- Relational Databases seem to be extremely useful in storing huge databases that have relationships via what type of information they can hold. Being able to navigate a large database seem as though it will be an easier task than trying to navigate through them manually.  However, the syntax can get long when chaining on multiple different elements to filter the information.  Overall, I feel like I have a decent grasp on what was covered in the practice lessons and look forward to learning on how to create effective tables of information in the future.
