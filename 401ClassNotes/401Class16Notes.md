## Notes: AWS: S3 and Lambda

[AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

- An EC2 instance is a virtual server for running applications on the AWS infrastructure.
- We can use it for hosting environments for different applications or development.  IT can also be used for high computing, backing up applications or even financially.
- It has extreme flexibility in comparison to other services such as heroku or render.  We can change underlying instances within the EC2 with only one post request as an example.

- We can find the EC2 on the AWS Console under the computer area of services and it should be the first option.
- T2 Micro and XL are both instance type offers from AWS as a part of EC2.  The T2 is small low cost option that is suitable for lightweight applications while the XL for larger workloads with databases, web servers, and larger applications.
-A compute cycle is a basic unit of work performed by a computer's processor. It represents a single step in processing information. During each cycle, the processor retrieves an instruction, interprets it, executes the instruction, and stores the result. These cycles happen very quickly, allowing the processor to handle tasks by breaking them down into smaller actions. By repeating compute cycles, the processor can efficiently perform calculations and complete tasks on a computer.

[Elastic Beanstalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrwxAScdyT0)

- Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of web applications and services
- EC2 and elastic beanstalk relationship is on how EB utilizes EC2 under the hood to run the higher lever services.  Without EC2 under the hood, EB would not be able to run since it is the core server that provides virtual servers in the cloud.
- EB has large scalability and high availability with its integration of AWS services. It also simplifies the application deployment and management.

## Additional Questions

- The module course schedule is a dead link for this reading.
- I think that being able to understand the Amazon documentation and how they work through through hosting things similar to render will be a large asset.  If I can be well versed in navigating these things, I could leverage that as an asset when being hired for a company that may use AWS.
