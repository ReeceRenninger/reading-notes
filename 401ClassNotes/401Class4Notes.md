[nosql vs sql](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

- For complex query intensive environments the best type of database is SQL.  The query power in SQL is much stronger than NoSQL for this type of environment.
- For hierarchical data storage the NoSQL database is a better fit since it follows the key-value pair way of storing data.
- SQL scalibility is increasable by increasing the hardware on a single server, this scales vertically.  This could mean increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD to increase the load available to the SQL server.  Whereas the NoSQL database is scaled horizontally.  You can add more servers easily in a NoSQL infastructure to handle larger traffic.
