### What is a Stack?

    A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.
   Common Terminology:

- **Push**: Add nodes or items into the stack.

- **Pop**: Remove nodes or items from the stack. Raises an exception when stack is empty.

- **Top**: The top of the stack.

- **Peek**: View the value of the top Node in the stack. Raises an exception when stack is empty.

- **IsEmpty**: Returns true when stack is empty, otherwise returns false.

- **Key Concepts**: FILO (First In Last Out), LIFO (Last In First Out).

- Operations are typically O(1) since they depend only on the top element, not on the number of elements in the stack.

**FILO(First In Last Out)**

- This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

**LIFO(Last In First Out)**

- This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

### Big O(1) operations with Stack

- Push O(1)

      Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.

      When adding a Node, you push it into the stack by assigning it as the new top, with its next property equal to the original top.
      
```javascript
ALOGORITHM push(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   node.next <-- Top
   top <-- Node

```

- Pop O(1)

      Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user.

      Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a pop. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

```javascript
ALGORITHM pop()
// INPUT <-- No input
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   Node temp <-- top
   top <-- top.next
   temp.next <-- null
   return temp.value

```

- Peek O(1)

      When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack.

      Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a peek. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

```javascript

ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   return top.value



```

- isEmpty(1)

```javascript

ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return top = NULL

```

### Big O(1) operations with Queue

- Enqueue O(1)

      When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

```javascript
ALGORITHM enqueue(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add to queue (will be wrapped in Node internally)
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   rear.next <-- node
   rear <-- node

```

- Dequeue O(1)

      When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.

      Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a dequeue. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

```javascript
ALGORITHM dequeue()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the removed Node
// EXCEPTION if queue is empty

   Node temp <-- front
   front <-- front.next
   temp.next <-- null

   return temp.value

```
