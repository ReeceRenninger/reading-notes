## Questions

1. Mental toughness.  I know I am not the smartest person in the room and I may never be that person. However, I have an uncommon characteristic of that most people lack. A pure grit mentality.  Everything I have learned or earned in my life has been a struggle of some sort.  I am perceived as intelligent, but I view myself as just persistent.  I hit a wall with something and I keep trying to break that wall down.  I don't try to avoid it or circumvent the problem somehow (unless that's actually the best solution).  I will always try to be the hardest working person in the room, because I have to be to.  I learn through failures and setbacks more than I ever have through any success in my life. My ability to improve will always be present, so I will always pursue it.  

2. I have a tendency to dive into problems that I think I see the solution for relatively quickly when I think I have it worked out in my brain.  I think taking my approach slower and planning out my actions will result in less time wasted and an overall more effective problem solving methodology.  The approach to problem solving in the Solving Problems source is something that I definitely need to get better at.  Being able to break the problem down into each tiny piece and write the pseduo code before ATTEMPTING the actual code will go a long way with me.  I had never heard of the 5 why approach to problems.  I think that is something I will use when trying to figure out a large problem into smaller sections.  It could also be used on how to trouble shoot an issue with a fellow team mate if something was not completed or another issue occurred and we aren't sure on why. Reframing the problems I approach with the idea that failure is just another step to success. The Mark Rober video is something I have seen before, but it was a nice refresher.
