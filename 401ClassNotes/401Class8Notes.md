[5 steps to RBAC](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3060780/security/5-steps-to-simple-role-based-access-control.html)

- RBAC (role based access control) allows users access to information based on their role in an organization. We care because this is a very powerful thing to utilize within a business. It can streamline a lot of priviledges that employees have access to when they join and easily eliminate them when they leave.
- A role permission hierarchy that could be implemented would be that of what employee needs access to what information.  Since not every employee may need to see documentation in every aspect of the business they can divide rights to the appropriate tier the employee is in for information.
- There is a 5 step approach for implementation.  
First, inventory your systems. Figure out the resources that need to be controlled access for each employees.
Second, analyze your workforce and create roles.  Group the workforce into roles with common needs to divide up the information in where it needs to go.
Third, assign people to those roles.
Fourth, never make one-off changes. If you begin doing this RBAC system it will quickly unravel if you begin doing one off changes. Either change the roles as required or add new ones.
Fifth, audit. Periodically review your roles and who is assigned to them with the access permitted to them.  

[wiki - RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)

- Authorization is granting or limiting access to system functions or resources.
- The 3 primary rules of RBAC are:
  1. Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.
  2. Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized.
  3. Permission authorization: A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject's active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can exercise only permissions for which they are authorized.
- Role based access control is what companies can use to allow their employees to gain access to specific information within the company based on their roles within the company.

- Rights are associated with roles. So different roles have different rights to access different material.  Users will take on roles after logging in.
- After a user log ins access rights will be activated based on their roles to allow what rights they have access to.
- RBAC is beneficial to businesses because it can allow new employees to be activated into a role with those rights attached.  Policy doesn't need to be updated when someone leaves since their role is terminated thus no more access to rights.
