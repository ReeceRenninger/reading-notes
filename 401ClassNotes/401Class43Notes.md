## Notes: React Native

[getting started with react native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)

- The three core components of React Native are View, Text, and Image.

    View: It is a container component used to create the structure and layout of the user interface, similar to the <div> element in HTML.
    Text: It is used to render text content on the screen, supporting basic text formatting and styling.
    Image: It is used to display images in the app, allowing the loading and rendering of local or remote images with various customization options.
- React Native solves the problem of developing mobile applications for multiple platforms (such as iOS and Android) using a single codebase. It is called "native" because React Native allows developers to build apps that utilize native components and APIs, providing a more native-like experience and performance compared to web-based approaches like hybrid or cross-platform frameworks.
- The building blocks of a React Native app are similar to a React app and include components, state management, and event handling. However, in React Native, the components are platform-specific, such as View, Text, and Image, which are rendered as native UI elements on the respective platforms. React Native also provides access to device-specific APIs, allowing developers to build apps with native capabilities, like accessing the camera or GPS. In contrast, React apps are primarily focused on rendering components in the browser and interacting with web APIs.

[expo](https://expo.io/)

- Expo provides a set of tools and services that simplify and accelerate the development of React Native applications. It offers features like an integrated development environment (IDE), pre-built UI components, and easy access to native device functionalities, allowing developers to build and deploy React Native apps more efficiently.
- Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the **managed** workflow.
- React Native is a framework that allows you to build native mobile apps using JavaScript and React. It provides the core libraries and tools necessary for app development. Expo, on the other hand, is a set of additional tools and services built on top of React Native, offering a more streamlined and simplified development experience by handling many common tasks like build configuration, over-the-air updates, and access to native APIs. While React Native is more flexible and customizable, Expo provides a higher level of abstraction and convenience for rapid development.

[expo snack](https://snack.expo.io/)

- It allows you to scan the QR code with your phone to preview the changes made while typing the code.  Seems pretty cool to allow for easier on the go checking of code changes if you were working on a project and needed to stay up to date with the changes.

[ejecting](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/expokit/eject)

- In the context of Expo, "eject" refers to the process of transitioning an Expo project to a regular React Native project. It allows developers to gain more control and customization by exposing the underlying native code and build configurations, but it also means taking on the responsibility of managing and maintaining those aspects of the project themselves.
- You should avoid ejecting from Expo if you want to leverage the simplicity and convenience offered by Expo's managed workflow, especially if you don't have specific requirements that necessitate custom native code modifications or complex build configurations. Ejecting adds complexity and increases the maintenance burden, so it's best to stay in the managed workflow if it meets your project's needs.
- You may choose to eject from Expo if you require extensive customization or need to access low-level native APIs that are not available through Expo's managed workflow. Ejecting allows you to gain full control over the native code and build configuration, enabling you to incorporate custom native modules and modify the underlying platform-specific code to meet your specific requirements.

- Everything seems super important with this course schedule as it looks like everything is building on one another so hopefully I can nail down the foundations of each topic as we go along.
