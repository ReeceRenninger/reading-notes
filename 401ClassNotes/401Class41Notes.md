- Next.js has a large amount of things you can learn but two of them would be:

      Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Next.js provides built-in support for server-side rendering, which means that the server can generate the initial HTML content and send it to the client. This allows search engines to crawl and index the content effectively, leading to better SEO performance. Additionally, SSR improves the initial page load time by pre-rendering the HTML on the server, providing a faster and more interactive user experience.

     Automatic Code Splitting and Prefetching: Next.js offers automatic code splitting, which means that only the necessary JavaScript code for each page is loaded, reducing the initial bundle size. It also intelligently prefetches the JavaScript and other assets required for subsequent pages, enhancing the overall performance and reducing the time it takes to navigate between pages. This feature helps in optimizing the application's performance and ensuring a smoother user experience.

- Gatsby.js documentation dives into a multitude of different things that Gatsby.js can do but a couple big ones I found were:

      Static Site Generation (SSG): Gatsby.js is primarily focused on static site generation, which means that it pre-builds all the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during the build process. This allows for incredibly fast page loads as the content is already generated and ready to be served to the client. Gatsby.js achieves this by pulling data from various sources, such as APIs or markdown files, and rendering static pages that can be deployed to a web server or CDN.

      GraphQL Integration: Gatsby.js integrates seamlessly with GraphQL, a query language for APIs. It leverages GraphQL to fetch data from different sources and transform it into a unified GraphQL data layer. This enables developers to easily retrieve and manage data from multiple locations, such as content management systems or databases, in a single GraphQL query. The GraphQL integration in Gatsby.js simplifies data fetching and enables efficient and flexible content management for websites, making it easier to create dynamic and data-driven web applications.
