## Notes

[Event Driven Programming](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-event-driven-programming)

- Node.js provides a module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started with event driven programming.
- Combining object oriented programming along with event-driven programming allow for individual objects to be handled within the code.  This allows for all different units within an application to communicate and interact with each other. This can allow for the revers of communication within our objects, they can just trigger events instead of reaching into another object and they listeners will trigger based off that emission.
- Event driven programming interacts with web browsers based on how you interact with the webpage through the interface. You trigger the event when you click a button or hold down a key.

## Additional Questions

- Looking ahead of the module I think I am most interested in the guided project and figuring out trees. After doing the reading on trees, it makes me feel like linked lists was actually the easiest we were going to get for DS problems.
- Learning how to leverage events more in my programming.  I feel like that could be the beginning of understanding how self-driving cars work or machine learning.
