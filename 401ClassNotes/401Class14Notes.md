## Notes:

[Read Today's Lab Requirements](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-14/lab/)

1. I think implementing a typing style game that would have users trying to complete a set of words of sentences within a certain time period would be a cool idea and something that could be expanded upon after 401 or used in the midterm project in some way.

1. Implement a real time chat application with a small front end side to allow for useage outside of the terminal.  We could just have a simple chat box as the front end and figure out how to have it be running on Netlify if there is any configuration changes.  We could maybe even try to set up some type of strict user access to make it a "secret chat room".
