## Notes:

[Extracting State Logic into a Reducer](https://react.dev/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer)

- The motivation for adding a reducer in React is to manage complex state and state transitions in a more organized and predictable manner. It helps in centralizing state logic, handling actions, and updating the state based on those actions, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.
- In the context of a reducer, actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe a state change. They typically have a type property that specifies the type of action and may also contain additional data relevant to the state update. Actions are different from setting state directly because they provide a standardized way to describe state changes and can be processed by the reducer function to update the state in a controlled and predictable manner. By dispatching actions to the reducer, it becomes easier to track and manage state transitions, implement complex logic, and maintain a clear separation between state management and component code.

## Class Notes

- Just getting better at state seems to be the major goal.  The state seems to ramp up even more on this module and I feel the weakest there with React.
