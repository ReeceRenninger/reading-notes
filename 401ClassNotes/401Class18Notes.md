## Notes: AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

[AWS API Gateway overview](https://www.serverless.com/amazon-api-gateway)

- Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables developers to create, deploy, and manage APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for their applications. It acts as a gateway between clients and backend services, allowing secure and efficient communication, API versioning, access control, and other features, simplifying the process of building scalable and robust APIs.
- Amazon API Gateway is an important part of the Serverless ecosystem because it provides a scalable and managed solution for handling API requests, enabling easy integration with serverless functions and allowing developers to build and deploy serverless applications with efficient API management capabilities
- API Gateway integrates with other AWS services through various mechanisms such as Lambda function integration, direct integration with other AWS services, and custom integration. This allows developers to seamlessly connect API Gateway with services like AWS Lambda, AWS DynamoDB, AWS S3, and more, enabling easy data retrieval, storage, and processing as part of API workflows.

- Some benefits of using Amazon API Gateway include: simplified API creation and management, support for various integration options, built-in security and access control, scalability to handle high traffic volumes, seamless integration with other AWS services, and detailed monitoring and analytics capabilities to gain insights into API performance and usage.
- Two API types that you might choose from are RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer) and WebSocket APIs.

[AWS DynamoDB Guide](https://www.dynamodbguide.com/what-is-dynamo-db/)

- DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), offering fast and flexible storage for applications. It provides high scalability, durability, and low latency, making it suitable for various use cases such as web and mobile applications, gaming, IoT, and more.
- MongoDB is a free database service that can handle most small to medium style applications, where DynamoDB is a paid service it has a more streamline and scalable option.  You only have to worry about usage concerns and are not responsible for installing any software, managing servers, or increasing your cluster size.

[AWS DyanmoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)

- DynamoDB is a highly scalable and organized database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to store and retrieve large amounts of data, automatically distributing and replicating it for high performance and durability.

[Dynamoose](https://dynamoosejs.com/getting_started/Introduction)

- Dynamoose is a JavaScript library that provides an easy-to-use interface and modeling framework for interacting with Amazon DynamoDB, simplifying the development of applications that use DynamoDB as a database. Similar to mongoose to MongoDB.
- Dynamoose allows for object data modeling.  This allows developers to define models for their data with intuitive syntax so it is easier to navigate.  Integration with promises allows for it to integrate with promises to allow for more efficient and readable code.

## Reflection

- Being able to utilize Dynamoose seems to be the big thing I need to learn so I can properly know how to navigate and utilize DynamoDB.
