## Notes: Graphs

Vocabulary/Definition list:

    Graph: A non-linear data structure consisting of vertices (or nodes) connected by edges.

    Vertex: Also known as a "node," a vertex is a data object in a graph that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

    Edge: A connection between two nodes in a graph.

    Neighbor: The adjacent nodes connected to a particular node via an edge.

    Degree: The number of edges connected to a vertex, indicating the degree of connectivity of that vertex.

    Directed Graph: Also called a "Digraph," a directed graph is a graph where every edge is directed and has a specific requirement for the next node to be referenced.

    Undirected Graph: A graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional, meaning there is no specific direction associated with the edges.

    Complete Graph: A graph in which all nodes are connected to every other node.

    Connected Graph: A graph in which every vertex/node has at least one edge connecting it to another node.

    Disconnected Graph: A graph in which some vertices may not have edges, resulting in isolated nodes or islands.

    Acyclic Graph: A directed graph without any cycles, where a cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.

    Cyclic Graph: A graph that contains cycles, where a cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.

    Adjacency Matrix: A 2-dimensional array representation of a graph, where each row and column represents a vertex, and the matrix elements indicate the presence or absence of edges between vertices.

    Adjacency List: A common way to represent a graph, using a collection of linked lists or arrays that list all the other vertices connected to a particular vertex.

    Weighted Graph: A graph in which numbers, called weights, are assigned to the edges.

    Traversals: The process of visiting and exploring the nodes of a graph.

    Breadth First Traversal: A graph traversal algorithm that visits nodes level by level, starting from a specific vertex/node, and utilizes a queue data structure to keep track of visited nodes.

    Depth First Traversal: A graph traversal algorithm that visits nodes by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, utilizing a stack data structure to keep track of visited nodes.

    GPS and Mapping: Real-world applications of graphs include GPS systems and mapping services that use graphs to represent routes and connectivity between locations.

    Social Networks: Graphs are used to model and analyze social networks, representing individuals as nodes and connections as edges.

    Airline Traffic: Graphs are utilized to represent flight routes and connections in the airline industry, enabling efficient route planning and analysis.

    Netflix Recommendations: Graphs are employed by platforms like Netflix to provide personalized recommendations by analyzing the connections between users, movies, and preferences.
