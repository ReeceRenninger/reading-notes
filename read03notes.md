# Read 03: Revisions and the Cloud

[Git Intro](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/)
- Through version control you can revert or project a previous version of a file. You can also modify and change them. (VCS)
- Centralized Version Control System (CVCS). Single server storing all the different changes and file versions that can be accessed by various people. This allows for more diverse collaboration and knowledge of who is doing what.
- Distributed Version Control System (DVCS).  Solution to the main problem with the CVS being a single point of failure.
DVCS allows for mirrored repositories to ensure there are backups if anything happens. This also allows for simultaneous workflows.
- Git is essentially a DVCS on steroids.  Helps track corrupted files, lost files, does snapshot saves.

- Large amount of steps that we did during installfest, good reference point if I ever need to redo this for any reason.
- We can import and clone using the terminal.

- Can utilize git stash to store changes without committing to the file.  git stash apply can retrieve the hidden changes.
- Remote repositories can have set read/write or read-only privleges. This is where you can push information or pull data from.
- git remote command you can view origins of remote handles that you specify.
- get remote -v will show all the remote URLs next to the names.








## Things i want to know more about
- Need to play around in the terminal more to get comfortable with all of these new commands.
- Learning how to navigate more efficiently in repositories.
