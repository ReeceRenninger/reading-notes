### Growth Mindset
- My interpretatiton of growth mindset is to always be open to the aspect of failing as you progress through something new. Don't feel defeated when I get to material that is new or difficult. Everyone was where I am at some point and there is always a way to progress.

Reminders to stay in Growth Mindset
1. Be comfortable being uncomfortable
2. Don't hit a wall and stay there forever
3. Utilize my fellow classmates and instructors when I get stuck
