## Hello my name is Reece Renninger and I am currently a student at Code Fellows in the 102 class. I am a United States Marine Corps veteran and attended California State University Long Beach where I earned my BA in Psychology.  I am pursuing this new career in tech because it has always been a passion I have wanted to pursue.

### Growth Mindset
- My interpretation of growth mindset is to always be open to the aspect of failing as you progress through something new. Everyone was where I am at some point and there is always a way to progress forward. Understanding that there will be problems that I may not be able to answer on my own at the start of this journey and that I will need help with.  Finally, maintain a positive mindset with each misstep that is bound to occur.

Reminders to stay in Growth Mindset
1. Be comfortable being uncomfortable. Understand that I will feel like I am behind or not getting something as fast as my fellow classmates, and that is okay.  Everyone progresses at their own speed and I will get there.
2. Don't hit a wall and stay there forever. Do not become stubborn and try to move the immovable object with unstoppable force.  Take a break, ask questions of others, or simply seek help.
3. Utilize my fellow classmates and instructors when I get stuck. Teamwork makes the dream work.  Make new connections, feed off each others strengths, and acknowledge each other's weaknesses. Help each other build and you will all succeed.
