## **Welcome to the _THUNDERDOME_ of notes**

## Hello my name is Reece Renninger and I am currently a student at Code Fellows in the 102 class. I am a United States Marine Corps veteran and attended California State University Long Beach where I earned my BA in Psychology.  I am pursuing this new career in tech because it has always been a passion I have wanted to pursue.
