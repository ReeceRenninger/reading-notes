[How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

1. He helped write the first web servers to send documents across the internet and then did a ton of research explaining why web works the way it does.
2. Because our techniques were built to talk to any machine at first, then future techniques were developed to talk to a small group of machines.
3. It was created with the intent of something like applying verbs to nouns. It utilizes verbs like GET to send a request for a browser and comes back as a web page. 
4. GET retrieves something and brings it back, which can be applied to a multitude of different things like an image, text, video, slideshow etc.
5. POST is how one system can add something to another system.
6. PUT can be used to replace something in another system.
7. PATCH does something similar to PUT but it does only a partial update.

API Keys

- Request a personal API key from the following APIs. You should receive these in your email within a few hours, often within minutes. Please request these keys prior to lecture to allow adequate time because you will need them in order to complete your lab assignment. Note: do not post your API keys in the Canvas discussion or on GitHub. Save them in a secure place.
