## Notes: In memory storage

[Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4)

1. A call is a function invocation.
2. The call stack is single function execution so they are done one at a time.
3. Last In, First Out (LIFO) is what the call stack uses as its principle to temporarily store and manage function calls(invocations);
4. ![call stack](/call-stack-drawing.png)
5. Stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function, something that calls itself, without an exit point. The dreaded infinite loop.

[JavaScript error messages](https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c)

1. Reference error is a simple error that occurs when you use a variable that is not yet declared
2. Syntax error occurs when your syntax for a function or method is done improperly. Something can not be parsed in terms of syntax.
3. Range errors occur when an object is manipulated to some kind of length and give it an invalid length.
4. Type error occur when the data type you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.
5. A break point is something a coder can set in a debugger to halt the process of their code to see what is happening at that specific line.  It allows for the coder to manually trigger the next processes of their code to view where something may be going wrong.
6. You can place a debugger statement in the code line manually if you want to have a break. debugger;
