## Notes: NODE.JS

[An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js)

1. Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
2. The V8 JS engine is the engine that runs in chrome, Brave, Opera, and vivaldi browsers.  Responsible for compiling JS directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.
3. I think it means to where our JS is executed, so our JS is executed on Node through the browser.
4. npm is a node package manager that is a library and registry for JS software packages that you can install on your local machine through the terminal.
5. I am running Node v19.7.0
6. I am running npm version 9.5.0
7. npm install -g jshint which will install it GLOBALLY
8. Node creates a sensible development environment in which all the different frameworks that can be installed to be used in. It also allows for JS to run on the server.

[6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1. Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills, job interview readiness, work environment readiness.
2. Learning from fellow students. I am not the best in certain areas of coding and other students are more advanced in them so its nice to get ideas from them.
3. It involves two developers to work together in the same workstation. One will be the driver, who is typing the code. While the navigator reviews each line of code as it is entered and verifies it to be good code (to the best of their ability). These roles rotate.
