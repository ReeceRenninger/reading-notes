## Notes

[Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

1. A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.
2. Components have characteristics of reusability, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated, and independent.  Reusability allows components are meant to be reused in different situations in different applications. Replaceable allow components to be substitued with other similar components.  Not context specific allows components to be operated in different environments and with different contexts. Extensible allows components to be extended from existing components to provide new behaviors.  Encapsulated allows a component to depict interface which allows users to use its functionality and do not expose inner workings.  Independent allows components to be designed with minimal dependencies on other components.
3. The advantages of component-based architecture is its ease of deployment, reduced cost, reusable, modification of technical complexity, reliability, system maintenance and evolution, and independence.

[What is Props and How to Use it in React](https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0#:~:text=%E2%80%9CProps%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20special%20keyword,way%20from%20parent%20to%20child)

1. Props stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another. Data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow (one way from parent to child).
2. Props are used in React by defining an attribute and its value(data), then pass it to child component(s) by using Props, then render the Props Data. 
3. Props flow goes from parent to child components.
