## Notes: React and Forms

[React Docs - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

1. A controlled component is a component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in component's state.
2. Having the state update with the responses as soon as they enter them requires some more code to be typed, however this can allow for us to pass the value to other UI elements or reset from event handlers which will make the user input more usable for future coding.
3. We have to pass the event handler info into a component.

[The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained](https://codeburst.io/javascript-the-conditional-ternary-operator-explained-cac7218beeff)

1. You can use a ternary when we are not able to use an if/else statement, like in react. It is also a more condensed version so you can create conditionals that are one line instead of 5+.  
2.

``` javascript
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

let x = 3;
let y = 4;
x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
```
