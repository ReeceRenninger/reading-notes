SQL vs NoSQL, 5 differences

| SQL    | NoSQL |
| -------- | ------- |
| Table based databases |  document based, key-value pairs, graph database or wide-column stores  |
|  Primarily relational databases |  Primarily non-relational or distributed databases  |
|  Vertically scalable, scaled by increasing horsepower of the hardware | Horizontally scalable, scaled by increasing the database servers in the pool of resources to reduce load  |
|  Uses structured query language for defining and manipulating data, very powerful | queries are focused on collection of documents, sometimes called UnQL    |
| Predefined schema  | dynamic schema for unstructured data   |

1. SQL databases are good for complex query intensive environments, they are best fit for data that is not heirarchical.
2. SQL databases are good for heavy duty transactional type applications, so something like processing payments through a webpage.
3. NoSQL databases are better for hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair of storing data similar to a JSON.
4. An itemized set of data that needed to house something that involves key value pairs, like displaying a brand with a specific type of clothing.
5. NoSQL is better for hierarchical data.
6. SQL are better for scalability.

1. SQL stands for Structured Query Language
2. A relational database works with SQL. The relational database is made to recognize relations among stored items.
3. Relational databases work with data in tables.
4. A schema is how data is organized within a relational database, such as the table names, fields, data types and relationship between them.
5. A NoSQL database is that holds large amounts of data similar to tables but they have collections then documents.
6. A NoSQL database works by storing data in documents rather than relational tables like SQL.
7. MongoDB has data records as documents which when combined created collections. These databases store one or more collections of those documents.
8. MongoDB is more flexible because it does not have the strict schema that the SQL does.
9. They do not support ACID. Atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.
