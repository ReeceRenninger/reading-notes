## Notes: More CRUD

[CRUD Basics](https://medium.com/geekculture/crud-operations-explained-2a44096e9c88)

1. I would use the PUT method to update a record through an API.
2. The ID is needed in the PUT method to ensure that we only update the resource that is targeted. DELETE also requires the unique id to ensure we are removing the appropriate item.

- Watch a Twitch Streamer code an Express API in 20 minutes!

1. CRUD is a way of manipulating information that describes functions of an application while REST controls data through HTTP commands. So CRUD manipulates information while we use REST to control that data.
2. Step one, create a router. Step Two, enable all the paths needed in the router. Step Three, mount the routes so that they can be accessed and set up try/catch on each path created with your routes. Step four, insert the values into the database. Step five, create the front end to allow the interface of the API. Step six, I am still very confused watching that streamer speed run that. But, it was cool.
