## Notes: State and Props

[React Lifecycle](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093)

![React Flow Diagram](/reactFlowDiagram.png)

1. Since the flow of information for React is top to bottom the diagram shows the render happening before the component did mount.

2. The first phase is Mounting which contains the constructor.

3. The order for the following things are Constructor, render, React Updates,componentDidMount(),componentWillUnmount()

4. componentDidMount() is invoked after a component is mounted. It can be used to load anything that is network request or initialize the DOM.

[React State VS Props](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYvD9oBCuJI)

1. Props can be passed what we want to initliaze our component at. So, if we were using a counter, we would pass the initial value to the prop.
2. The big difference between props and states is props are passed into components while states are handled inside the component. Props have to be updated outside the component
3. Whenever we change the state we will have to re render for it to be updated.
4. We can store the values of an input in form from a user or any other type of data or information about the component itself that we need to keep stored.
