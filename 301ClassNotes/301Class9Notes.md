## Notes: Functional Programming

[Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

1. Functional programming is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treat computations as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
2. A pure function is that is returns the same arguments, referred to as determinstic and it does not cause any observable side effects.
3. The code is easier to test, no mock needed so they can be tested with different contexts.  Given A expect the function to return value B and given C expect a return of D.
4. Immutability is the inability to change over time or unable to be changed at all. The state of the data CANNOT change after its creation.
5. pure functions + immutable data = referneital transparency.  This allows for entire expressions with a numerical constant can be replaced and [memoized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization).

[Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHLd36QoS4k)

1. A module is just another JS file essentially.
2. Require receives a string that is similar to react by typing ./target to grab a function into another module.
3. We bring another module into a file by saying module.exports = what I want avaiable outside of its home module.
4. To make a module available we have to set a variable equal to the module being exported to use on another module.
