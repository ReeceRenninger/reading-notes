## Notes: Basics of Web Pages

[How the web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works)

[Website Design and Processes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/What_will_your_website_look_like)

1. The way you talk to me, reminds of my HTTP, always selecting the right language, to keep talking to me
2. The HTML file is parsed first so the browser can recognize any link or script elements. Then it resends a request for any external files of CSS or JS based off link or script elements. Then it builds the DOM tree from the HTML, a CSSOM structure from the CSS and compiles and executes the Javascript. As all of that happens you then get a display or visual representation of the page content.
3. You can use something as simple as [google images](https://www.google.com/imghp?gws_rd=ssl). From there you can download or hyperlink an image, BUT you need to be careful of copyright licenses. So you can google license filter through the tools button -> usage rights option -> then creative common licenses. I found out about [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) during my 102 class for finding images that are not copyrighted.
4. Strings require quotes either single ' or double " wrapped around the information to be established as a string.  Numbers do not require any type of quotes so they can be simply inputted as a number, ex. let x = 10;.
5. A variable holds values that we assign to it. That could be a string, number, boolean, an array, object, etc. These are VITAL in JS because it allows us to call back to those variables and use their contents in future code for functions, holding data, or even being a container for future code to be pushed in to.

[Getting Started with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started)

[HTML Document Structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure)

[Metadata in HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML)

1. Attributes are something only for us to see on the backend.  We could set an id or class to help us identify a specific element later as an example. These should have a space between the element name and it, a name, and a value wrapped in quote makrs.
2. The anatomy of an HTML element consists of an opening and closing tag with content present between the tags.
3. They are both considered semantic tags. The article tag creates an a block of independent information that doesn't require any context. Where the section tag is to break up the page into "sections" such as an intro, body, or ending if we were to visual the page like a paper. Section tags are usually used to group related content.
4. A basic webpage would have a header, navigation bar, main content, sidebar, and a footer.
5. By setting a primary language it will be indexed more effectively because it can then appear in the appropriate language by the user location or request. 
6. It can be used in several different ways from setting the language of a page, adding in author information of the page, or even a description of the page. Some sites such as FaceBook and Twitter have developed metadata specific elements to enhance their own pages.

## Miscellanous

[How to start to design a Website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Thinking_before_coding)

1. You need to define what you want to accomplish with your webpage. Define a goal or a direction of the project before starting.
2. What exactly do I want to accomplish? This is the driving question for everything else.

[Semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)

1. The h1 element is a semantic element.  Most browsers will automatically style it to be shown as a large font as a heading, where span can be made to look like a heading BUT you would need to specify the font size and margin position MANUALLY.
2. There are several reasons as to why you should use semantic tags. Some of those being semantic naming mirrors proper element/component naming, it suggests to the developer what type of data will be populated, it allows you to find meaningful blocks of codes and more.

[What is JavaScript?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)

1. For a page to not be considered a static page, JS is needed. To have updating content or interactive maps the page will require JS to be involved.
2. You can add JS internally by using the script element and inputting code between the tags. You can use an external page and connect them using a script tag with a src. Lastly, you can use JS inline which will be pieces of code living inside the HTML page itself.
