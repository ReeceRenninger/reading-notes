## Notes: CSS Transitions

[CSS Transforms](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

1. There are two different settings for transform, 2D and 3D that have their own individual properties and values.
2. I could use the transform property to alter a box that a user puts an answer into whether they get the question right or wrong.  I could rotate or alter the size of the box with a color change of some sort.

[CSS Transitions & Animations](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

1. Transition can be used with hover, focus, active, or target pseudo classes.  This can allow for a box to change color when a user hovers over it or change its size when the target is focused.
2. The CSS animation allows you to change an element over a specified duration while the transition defines how an element changes over a specific duration. Meaning the transition gives it the time period to animate over.
