[What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://web.archive.org/web/20221125192300/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

1. Conversational turn-taking is a large factor in psychological safety. Being able to be heard in a group setting and listen to others can create a safer and more collaborative space.  No one wants to be ran over by one person in a group setting.  Empathy being very important as well.  Being able to connect with your team or co workers beyond a work level allows for people to connect and care which will lead to better teams.  Another factor is having confidence in your team that you can be accepted for your flaws and not embarassed.  No one will always be perfect and get everything right on the first try.  However, being able to feel comfortable enough to take that risk is a game changer in the group setting.
2. When I worked in the Marine Corps, this was not a priority for most higher ups.  I was in charge of people and sometimes I had to say as it was. However, whenever I could, I always wanted my squad to feel like I respected their opinions and if they talked, I would listen. You can definitely feel the difference in a team when they feel confident in their team or when they feel detached.
3. They operate on a higher level.  They will be able to collaborate and come up with unique solutions faster than other teams because they are actually listening and taking in each other's ideas.  I would take a group of 5 brains over 1 any day, regardless of who they are.  If people can be open with their ideas and be comfortable to share that idea they think they may be ridiculed for, could be a game changer.  Imagine, having a crazy idea that maybe you don't know how to implement but someone else could.  That idea would be wasted because the group didn't allow you to feel you could say your idea.
