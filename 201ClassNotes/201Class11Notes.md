## Notes: Audio, Video, Images

[Video and Audio Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content)

1. The way we present video and audio on the web has changed completely. Prior technologies like Flash and Silverlight is what allowed for those to run, but now it can be routed directly into the web page and be controlled through JS.
2. Src is what can pull a video from a different website or a stored location. Controls enable the user to have their own interface for having control on the video from start or stopping to adjusting volume.
3. A paragraph inside the video tags is called the fallback content.  This information will be displayed if the browser doesn't support the video element in html. You can provide a direct link to the video to allow users to still access the direct source.
4. Audio and Video are two twin brothers, not identical. They both can give you similar outputs if you ask them to get something off the web for you. However, one will be able to display it to you with video and audio. While the other brother will just give you an audio to listen to.  Both can be vital in their own ways, but don't tell the other one that.

[A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

1. Grid allows us to manipulate elements on both the x and y axis simultaneously.  It will allow for more flexibility in how you move images around or text to fit things onto a page more efficiently.  
2. Grid container is what we would attach to an element to contain the content in.  The container is holding the elements we intend on applying the grid styling type to.  Grid items are what we are placing on the actual grid that is generated within the container.  These can be referenced to with the column start or row start depending on how you need to manipulate them.  Lastly, the grid line is a reference to a numbered grid line within the grid.  There is the first, line2, line3, end, last line, etc....

[Responsive Images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)

1. Because everyone has varying screen sizes that can be used to view your content.  Allowing the browser to have multiple image files for resolution scaling as the screen changes.  This will allow for a better user experience and better accessibility.
2. Srcset attribute will define a set of images that will allow the browser to choose between. The sizes attribute defines a set of screen widths and indicates what image size would be best to use dependong on what screen size is being used.
3.Srcset is better than using CSS or JS to manipulate images because it automatically takes into account the screen size on load where JS and CSS will operate AFTER page load has occured which then requires the image to be altered after the fact.
