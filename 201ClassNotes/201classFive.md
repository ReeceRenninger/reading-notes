[Using Images In HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Images_in_HTML)
[Common Image Types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types)
[Choosing Image Formats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#choosing_an_image_format)

1. If you inputted your file for your image the alt text information would be displayed instead which will easily allow you to be notified of your mistake. Alt text can also be beneficial for visually impaired that are using a screen reader.
2. Adding alt text can be one way to make images more accessible. Use meaningful file names for screen readers to read for the visually impaired. We can also add a title attribute which will add more context and give a mouseover effect.
3. Figure is primarily used for an image, diagram, code snippet or something else of that nature.  They are beneficial because they can be moved to a different part of the document and not affect the flow of the document.  They can also have a caption added inside using figcaption.
4. Both SVG(Scalable Vector Graphics) and GIF(Graphics Interchange Format) represent pictures, animated pictures or short videos.  GIFs do not look good as you try to make them larger or smaller on your screen where SVGs look good even when making the image larger or smaller.
5. I would use an SVG because if the image needs to be scaled up or down, it will retain its crisp resolution.

[Using Color in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Applying_color)
[Styling HTML Text Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals)

1. The foreground color in CSS changes the content, such as the text color in an HTML element. While the background color changes the color BEHIND the content or text. So foreground would represent the black text while background is the white behind it.
2. I could use color to make the texts have varying colors to make them pop off the page or add text decorations to the words to make them more unique looking in varying sections.  We could also change the background color of sections to color coordinate ideas or thoughts.
3. Accessibility and readability.  You do not want to have a wonky text that is difficult for people to read or even unable to read for people with poor eyesight.
4. Font-size adjusts the font size of the selected element.  Font-weight can make the text look bolder or lighter depending on the weight given as the value.  While font-style can change the font to be italics, normal, oblique.
5. We can use letter-spacing or word-spacing to provide spacing between letters or words within a selected text.
