1. If you inputted your file for your image the alt text information would be displayed instead which will easily allow you to be notified of your mistake. Alt text can also be beneficial for visually impaired that are using a screen reader.
2. Adding alt text can be one way to make images more accessible. Use meaningful file names for screen readers to read for the visually impaired. We can also add a title attribute which will add more context and give a mouseover effect.
3. Figure is primarily used for an image, diagram, code snippet or something else of that nature.  They are beneficial because they can be moved to a different part of the document and not affect the flow of the document.  They can also have a caption added inside using figcaption.
4. Both SVG(Scalable Vector Graphics) and GIF(Graphics Interchange Format) represent pictures, animated pictures or short videos.  GIFs do not look good as you try to make them larger or smaller on your screen where SVGs look good even when making the image larger or smaller.
5. I would use an SVG because if the image needs to be scaled up or down, it will retain its crisp resolution.
