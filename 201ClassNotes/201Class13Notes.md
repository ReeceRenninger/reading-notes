## Notes: Local Storage

[Local Storage and How to use It On Websites](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/local-storage-and-how-to-use-it/)

1. Storing the state of your interface locally can allow you to keep a key on the user computer and this allows the user to return to the page later from where they left off.
2. Only strings can be stored in the local storage which means objects will not be stored correctly. You would have to work around storing objects in another way.
3. Local storage can store strings and it can be converted by using JSON.stringify() or JSON.parse().
