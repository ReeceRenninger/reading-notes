## Notes: Chart.js, Canvas

[JavaScript Canvas](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-canvas/)

1. The canvas element allows developers to draw 2D graphics using JS.
2. Any content between the opening and closing tag of canvas is considered to be fallback content, so leaving the tag open can cause major errors.
3. the getContext() method takes one argument which is a form of context.  By passing in '2d' you would get 2D rendering context object.

[Chart.js Documentation](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/)

1. Chart.js is a charting library that allows you to use chart types, plugins, and customization options. It can allow for a lot of different customizable things that you do not have by default in the browser. I could use this in my salmon cookies page to generate a better looking page. Especially improving my sales page.
2. There are several different kinds of charts you can bring.  The first three listed are an Area, Bar, and Bubble chart.

1. Charts display data visually much better than a table can.  It allows for information to be conveyed quicker and can be created with the help of Chart.js.
2. I could add a chart to my sales page for my salmon cookies to display the information dynamically as users' create stores with the input form.  I could even go back to my 102 project and create a pizza sales chart just to improve the design of the page.
